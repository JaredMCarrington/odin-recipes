    <p>This BEST bread recipe makes the most deliciously fluffy loaf of white bread. It tastes so much better than store-bought!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2¼ cups warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar, plus 1 pinch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5½ – 6½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>butter for topping, (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve the yeast in warm water with a pinch of sugar. When the yeast is bubbly and foamy, add the sugar, salt, oil, and 4 cups flour, and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, to form a soft, smooth dough. The dough should stick just slightly to your finger when touched, but not be overly sticky. Knead for 5-7 minutes, until smooth, then roll into a ball.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn over once to coat the top with oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for one hour, or until doubled.</li>
        <li>When the dough has risen, punch it down gently and divide it in half. Roll each half of the dough into a long rectangle about 8 inches wide. Roll the dough up, starting at the short edge, to form a cylinder that is approximately 8 inches wide. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Place the dough, seam side down, into lightly greased bread pans, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for one hour, or until the dough is ½ – 1 inch higher than the top of the pan.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Brush with melted butter, if desired. Remove to a cooling rack and cool before slicing. MAKES 2 LOAVES.</li>
    </ol>
